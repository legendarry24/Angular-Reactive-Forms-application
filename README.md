## Introduction

This is an Angular 9 application with Reactive Forms based on the ["Angular: Getting Started"](http://bit.ly/Angular-GettingStarted) and ["Angular Reactive Forms"](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-2-reactive-forms) Deborah Kurata's courses on Pluralsight.
I've added a few improvements and refactorings to this app. Also implemented PathResolver with LevenshteinDistance algorithm for correct  path suggestion.

## Installing the code

See the `README.md` file under APM folder for details on installing and running the application.

The following are detailed instructions for installing the code.

0) Ensure you have node installed.

   At a command prompt, type `node -v` to ensure you have version `10.16.0` or higher before proceeding.

1) Download or clone the code from this repository.

   If you download as a zip file, be sure to unzip it.

2) Navigate to the APM folder.

   There should be a package.json file in this folder.

3) In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type `npm install`.

   This creates a node_modules folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder. You may see a few warnings during this process, but you should not see any errors.
   
4) In the same command window (or the Command property in VS Code), type `npm start`.

   The application should then compile and launch in your default browser.
